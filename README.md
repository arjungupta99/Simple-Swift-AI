# Simple-Swift-AI
A simple to use Feed Forward Neural Network built in Swift 3.0

### Usage
* A data set with multiple inputs and outputs can be used to train the network.
* The default number of hidden layers is one, more can be added as per need.
* The neuron output values range from 0 to 1.0. Modify your data set accordingly. 

### Features
* Feed-forward neural network with input, hidden and output layers
* Multiple hidden layers can be added with little extra code
* Can come in use for categorization and function value prediction
* Optional debug screen included for viewing the training and test outputs on simulator
